The website includes several features, which are detailed below.

### __Existing Features__

- __Colour Palette__
    - The website uses shades of blue, often associated with trust, safety, and growth. These colors are complemented by white to ensure readability and a clean look. The color palette is applied consistently across all elements of the website, including backgrounds, text, buttons, and links, to maintain a unified aesthetic.

- __Imagery__
    - A variety of images are used to enhance the content and make it more engaging. These images, produced using DALL-E, include photos of people, icons, and illustrations relevant to adult safeguarding. The imagery is carefully selected to evoke trust and empathy, crucial elements in the context of safeguarding. All images are optimized for fast loading times and are responsive, ensuring they look good on all devices. Additionally, alt text is provided for each image to improve accessibility for users with visual impairments.

- __Navigation Bar__
    - The navigation bar, located at the top of the page, provides links to all the main sections of the website. It helps users navigate between different pages and indicates the current active page with an underline. The navigation bar is fully responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
