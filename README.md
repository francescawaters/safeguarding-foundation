# __Portfolio Project 1 - Safeguarding Foundation__
This website has been create to fulfil the project brief for Code Institutes first individual assessment.


## __Description__
Safeguarding Foundation is a fully responsive static HTML and CSS website that aims to inform those interested in learning about adult safeguarding and what to do if you recognise a safeguarding issue.

## __Wireframes__
Before starting the project I created a couple basic wireframes to have an idea of what my final product would look like. I created a mobile wireframe and a desktop wireframe.

This project was deployed on GitHub. Below are the steps I followed to be able to deploy the website:
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Scroll down until you see GitHub pages.
3. From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch.
4. Once the main branch has been selected hit the save button.
5. Finally, when the page is refreshed there will be a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
